      description:
        "The University of Azores hosts the Azores Bioportal (http://azoresbioportal.uac.pt/) a regional E-Infrastructure. The Azorean Biodiversity Portal (ABP) is an e-infrastructure now associated with Portuguese PORBIOTA and LIFEWATCH. The ABP is a key e-infrastructure for the integrated management of biodiversity data of the Azores, providing a large number of specialized services supporting research, policy and education. The 3000 visits per day, the numerous international scientific collaborations, resulting in publications and academic thesis, and the connection with other prestigious databases demonstrate the Portal’s scientific quality as well as its general appeal. Several Natural History Collections are also managed by University of Azores, namely of Algae, Bryophytes, Vascular Plants, Molluscs and Arthropods.The Azorean Biodiversity Portal shares all the information available on the biodiversity of the Azores, one of the five Macaronesian archipelagos (the other being Madeira, Salvage Islands, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde). Macaronesia is recognized as an important part of the Mediterranean hotspot of biodiversity; however, a comprehensive systematic revision of its biodiversity was still lacking at the end of the 20th century.\nBased in two European INTERREG IIIB projects, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 200 taxonomists and other scientists resulted in accurate and comprehensive lists of terrestrial species in the Canary Islands (Izquierdo et al., 2001, 2004; Moro et al., 2003), Cape Verde (Arechavaleta et al., 2005), the Azores (Borges et al., 2005b, 2010) and Madeira–Selvagens (Borges et al., 2008). This unique collaboration was fundamental for creating the baseline taxonomic information for the ABP, updating the taxonomic information, listing synonyms.",

Managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBird’s goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement globally, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. The result is that eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.",

      description:
        "Dès la création de leur Fédération (FCBN - www.fcbn.fr) en 1999, les onze Conservatoires botaniques nationaux (CBN) ont exprimé la volonté collective de constituer un système d’information national pour mettre en commun leurs données, et celles de leurs partenaires, sur la flore, la fonge et les végétations-habitats. C’est réellement en 2010 avec le lancement de l’établissement du Format Standard de Données sur la flore (FSD Flore), conçu comme le « format commun de données de la Fédération des CBN », que la démarche a été initiée. Il s’en est suivi de nombreux échanges ayant permis de finaliser le format, de le tester sur les premiers jeux de données, d’établir une charte d’adhésion au projet et d’élaborer le cadrage final de l’exercice d’agrégation des données. Le projet s’est concrétisé au premier trimestre 2013 à travers la mise au format des données détenues par les CBN et leur intégration dans le Système d’Information de la FCBN (SI-Flore). A l’horizon de l’année 2014, il résulte, de ce projet structurant, que la FCBN dispose d’un système d’information d’envergure nationale et fort de plus de 20 millions de données d’observation sur la flore de France. Les données centralisées ont été consolidées sur la base du référentiel TAXREF 5.0 et une mise à jour est prévue pour fin 2015.",

        "Bird tracking - GPS tracking of Lesser Black-backed Gulls and Herring Gulls breeding at the southern North Sea coast is a species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and described (v5.5) in Stienen et al. 2016 (https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.555.6173). The dataset contains close to 8.5 million occurrences (GPS fixes) recorded by GPS trackers mounted on 108 Lesser Black-backed Gulls and 37 Herring Gulls breeding at the Belgian and Dutch coast. The trackers are developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, http://www.uva-bits.nl) and allow to study the gulls' habitat use and migration behaviour in great detail. Our bird tracking network is operational since 2013 and is maintained and used by the INBO, the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), UvA-BiTS, Ghent University (UGent), and the University of Antwerp (UA). See the dataset metadata for contact information, scope, and methodology. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/bird-tracking-gull-occurrences\nThe following information is not included in the dataset and available upon request: outliers, speed, temperature, barometric pressure, accelerometer data, GPS metadata (fix time, number of satellites used, vertical accuracy), bird biometrics data measured during tagging (bill length, bill depth, tarsus length, wing length, body mass), life history data (day of ringing, age, resightings by volunteers), as well as growth data of chicks.\nTo allow anyone to use this dataset, we have released the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). We would appreciate however, if you read and follow these norms for data use (http://www.inbo.be/en/norms-for-data-use) and provide a link to the original dataset (https://doi.org/10.15468/02omly) whenever possible. If you use these data for a scientific paper, please cite the dataset following the applicable citation norms and/or consider us for co-authorship. We are always interested to know how you have used or visualized the data, or to provide more information, so please contact us via the contact information provided in the metadata, opendata@inbo.be or https://twitter.com/LifeWatchINBO.\nThe bird tracking network used to collect these data is set up and maintained by the INBO and VLIZ as part of the Flemish contribution to LifeWatch.",

      description:
        "The GBIF Backbone Taxonomy, often called the Nub taxonomy, is a single synthetic management classification with the goal of covering all names GBIF is dealing with.             It's the taxonomic backbone that allows GBIF to integrate name based information from different resources, no matter if these are occurrence datasets, species pages, names from nomenclators or external sources like EOL, Genbank or IUCN.             This backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names from one source to another.             It is updated regulary through an automated process in which the Catalogue of Life acts as a starting point also providing the complete higher classification above families.             The following 56 sources from the  have been used to assemble the GBIF backbone:                             Catalogue of Life (3175925 names);                Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (733720 names);                World Register of Marine Species (333396 names);                The Plant List with literature (287022 names);                The Paleobiology Database (147044 names);                Index Fungorum (137347 names);                International Plant Names Index (114127 names);                Backbone Family Classification Patch (94826 names);                Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) (69148 names);                Artsnavnebasen (33510 names);                Plazi.org taxonomic treatments database (32543 names);                GRIN Taxonomy (30748 names);                The Clements Checklist (19663 names);                Dyntaxa - Svensk taxonomisk databas (15173 names);                Brazilian Flora Checklist - Brazilian Flora 2020 project - Projeto Flora do Brasil 2020 (13067 names);                Mammal Species of the World (6393 names);                Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology (5790 names);                International Cichorieae Network  (ICN): Cichorieae Portal (5032 names);                Orthoptera Species File (4826 names);                Catalogue of Afrotropical Bees (4640 names);                Database of Vascular Plants of Canada  (VASCAN) (4323 names);                Prokaryotic Nomenclature Up-to-date (4151 names);                Taxon list of fungi and fungal-like organisms from Germany compiled by the DGfM (4034 names);                IOC World Bird List, v6.3 (3830 names);                Checklist of Beetles  (Coleoptera) of Canada and Alaska.
